## Social score MMA fights 

In the world of Mixed Martial Arts and Boxing, the subjectively scored rounds can become a bit contentious. Fans frequently post to Twitter and other social media sites the scores they would have given to the fighters, round by round. With YouDaJudge we bring all those scores together on one platform and allow you to compare your scores with your friends right from your homepage.
